## Work Experience

### Full Stack Web Developer

**Company:** Hegar Soluciones en Sistemas  
**Start Date:** May 2024  
**End Date:** Present  

- I rejoined to lead the development of a web application that will be used by multiple companies for managing distribution, production, and sales. I architected a modular and scalable solution to ensure data integrity and security across different organizations.
- I designed an independent database structure for each company, ensuring complete information isolation between clients. I used an authentication provider that stores metadata about each organization's connections. This approach allows me to establish secure and dynamic connections to the corresponding database on the server, eliminating the risk of data exposure between organizations.
- I chose Next.js and Server Actions to optimize development and data handling in a secure and flexible way, leveraging the platform's full-stack model. This approach not only reduces the separation between frontend and backend but also accelerates the workflow and ensures proper implementation of user roles and permissions, without the need for an additional backend team.
- For the user interface development, I chose ShadcnUI, a system that allows me to create highly customizable interfaces focused on delivering an excellent user experience (UX). While the development process can be slower due to its flexible approach, the main advantage is the ability to adjust any visual or functional aspect as needed, tailoring the interface to complex or customized user flows without compromising quality. This provides complete control over the presentation and ensures that the UI is fully adaptable to client needs.

### Full Stack Web Developer

**Company:** Ventus Global Logistics  
**Start Date:** July 2023  
**End Date:** May 2024  

- Successfully reduced recurring tickets by 80% by addressing the root causes of bugs and developing a user-friendly web application using ASP MVC, htmx, and Tailwind CSS. This app automated previously manual system department tasks, significantly enhancing user experience and operational efficiency.
- Developed a Web application using ASP MVC, Entity Framework (EF), htmx, and Tailwind CSS for users in the accounting department. It is a simple web app that will send you some invoices depending on what you select in the frontend. The invoices are generated from a Visual Basic Class which already existed on a project that needed to be migrated. Instead of wasting time rewriting the logic, I encapsulated the class and added it to the ASP.MVC backend, from where it calls this class. This made it easy to migrate the service without having to do a whole rewrite.
- Developed a Web application using ASP MVC, Entity Framework (EF) which scaffolded its endpoints using ADA Controllers. This made it trivial to create TypeScript types in the frontend, which was written in Vue. This application creates electronic invoices depending on the choices of customer/provider/material selected. This means I had to create multiple views that remember the state of the previous UI to display different information.
- Developed a custom automated scheduling tool using Entity Framework (EF) to dispatch reports based on database-defined itineraries using C#. The tool features flexible scheduling options, including specific days of the week, precise times, and recurring dates like the 3rd Monday of each month.
- Wrote a PowerShell script to unzip and distribute those files inside a directory inside a VM that couldn’t have Python installed for easier scripting due to technical limitations. This script had to deal with nearly 32k unzipped folders, containing on average 10 files each, so I had to use multithreading in PowerShell. Not using multithreading would make the script take 10 days instead of 10 hours.
- Effectively reduced high compute costs for a cloud server after being alerted by the owner. I conducted a targeted profiling of the services running on the machine. This revealed a single function with a constant while loop, which was engaging the CPU at 100% capacity. Optimizing this function led to significant cost savings and improved server efficiency.
- Collaborated with coworkers in an urgent response to a customer request, successfully automating an entry generation process within a tight 3-day deadline by dedicating extra hours from Friday through Sunday.
- Daily bug fixing of our legacy codebase both by manual SQL/stored procedure debugging, and scripting SQL queries and network directory traversals in Python.

### Full Stack Web Developer

**Company:** Hegar Soluciones en Sistemas
**Start Date:** January 2023
**End Date:** July 2023

- Acquired Vue proficiency on-the-job and successfully migrated a codebase from JQuery and Django to Django Rest Framework (DRF) and Vue TypeScript within a tight 3-week timeframe.
- Designed and implemented an internal control system for order management and billing, involving weekly communication with the customer to guide development direction.
- Adhered to agile principles, ensuring responsiveness to customer needs and iterative improvement.
- Ventured independently into .NET Multi-platform App UI (MAUI), developing a test application to exceed client expectations, demonstrating initiative and commitment to go beyond the familiar.

## Miscellaneous

### Fotogenio

**Repository:** [github.com/PedroAVJ/fotogenio](https://github.com/PedroAVJ/fotogenio)
**Website:** [fotogenio.mx](https://fotogenio.mx)
An AI photo generator service that got around 20 users. It uses [replicate](https://replicate.com/) as the ML model provider. The main challenge was iterating quickly when manually testing the app would requires training the model again, since each user gets it's own fine tune. Since replicate doesn't provide a way to send test events, this was the only way to test the app.

### Battleship Web App

**Repository:** [github.com/PedroAVJ/battleship](https://github.com/PedroAVJ/battleship)  
Developed a feature-rich clone of the Battleship board game, incorporating unique elements like special abilities, map selection, and an AI opponent. The AI utilizes a heuristic-based algorithm with Monte Carlo search to optimize gameplay. Crafted the game board and sprites from scratch, using no external libraries and leveraging a reactive programming framework for dynamic interactivity.  

### Website based on Figma design

**Repository:** [github.com/PedroAVJ/Clarifion](https://github.com/PedroAVJ/Clarifion)  
This project showcases a static website, meticulously crafted to align with the design sketches provided in Figma, linked in the repo. The goal was to achieve a pixel-perfect realization of these designs, ensuring both aesthetic appeal and functional robustness.  

### Data Science Visualization

**Repository:** [github.com/PedroAVJ/ames-data-set](https://github.com/PedroAVJ/ames-data-set)  
**Visualization:** [Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/pedro.antonio.villanueva.juarez/viz/AmesHousingDataSet/Sheet2)  
This is a simple data cleaning visualization for the famous Ames Housing Data set using Python Jupyter Notebooks. The visualization showcases that the data point of the year built doesn’t affect the relationship between the size of the building and its sale price.
